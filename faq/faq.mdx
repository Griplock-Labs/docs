This page answers common questions about Griplock’s design, behavior, and scope.

---

## Is Griplock a wallet?

Griplock is not a traditional always-on wallet.

It is a **privacy and control layer** that creates temporary wallet sessions only when the user explicitly initiates access through physical intent.

---

## Does Griplock custody funds or keys?

No.

Griplock does not custody funds, private keys, or recovery data.  
All assets remain fully owned and controlled by the user on-chain.

---

## Is Griplock a card issuer or payment service?

No.

Griplock does not issue cards, provide card programs, or operate as a payment processor.  
NFC is used solely as a mechanism for local authentication and physical intent enforcement.

---

## Is Griplock a mixer or privacy obfuscation tool?

No.

Griplock does not pool, reroute, or obfuscate transactions.  
It does not hide balances or alter blockchain transparency.

Privacy is enforced by controlling **when and how interaction is possible**, not by modifying on-chain data.

---

## Are funds hidden from the blockchain?

No.

Funds always remain on-chain and verifiable.  
Griplock does not remove, disguise, or mask blockchain data.

---

## Does Griplock provide anonymity?

No.

Griplock reduces interaction exposure.  
It does not provide anonymity or unlinkability guarantees.

---

## Can Griplock recover my wallet if I lose access?

No.

Griplock cannot recover wallets, reset access, or bypass security controls.  
If required access factors are lost, funds remain on-chain but may be inaccessible through Griplock.

---

## What happens if my phone is lost?

If a device is lost:
- No active wallet session remains
- No signing capability exists
- Funds remain unaffected on-chain

Access can only be re-established by recreating a wallet session using the required access factors.

---

## What happens if my NFC card is lost?

An NFC card alone does not grant access.

Additional local confirmation is always required to create a wallet session.  
Loss of an NFC card does not automatically compromise funds.

---

## Does Griplock support swaps?

Swaps may be supported as a **basic wallet capability**.

They are not a core product focus and are not treated as financial services or yield strategies.

---

## Can Griplock be automated or used with bots?

No.

Griplock does not support background signing, automation, scheduled actions, or delegated execution.

All interactions require real-time user intent.

---

## Is Griplock production-ready?

Only features listed under **What’s Live** should be considered production-ready.

Anything labeled experimental may change, be removed, or never reach production.

---

## Why is Griplock designed this way?

Griplock prioritizes:
- Explicit user intent
- Reduced exposure
- Absence of always-on access

These design choices trade convenience for control and security.
