This page answers common questions about GripLock's design, behavior, and scope.

---

## Is GripLock a wallet?

GripLock is not a traditional always-on wallet.

It is a **privacy and control layer** that creates temporary wallet sessions only when the user explicitly initiates access through physical intent and factor authentication.

---

## Does GripLock custody funds or keys?

No.

GripLock does not custody funds, private keys, MASTER_SECRET, Shamir shares, or recovery data.
All assets remain fully owned and controlled by the user on-chain.

---

## Is there a seed phrase?

No.

GripLock V2 does not use a mnemonic seed phrase. The wallet is derived from a secure random 32-byte MASTER_SECRET, which is protected by a 2-of-3 Shamir threshold split across independent storage factors.

There is nothing to write down, memorize, or export.

---

## How does recovery work?

GripLock uses a **2-of-3 Shamir threshold** recovery model.

The MASTER_SECRET is split into three shares, stored across:
- **Google Drive** — Encrypted share in the user's cloud storage
- **Device** — Encrypted share on the user's local device
- **Passkey** — Encrypted share bound to a WebAuthn passkey credential

Any 2 of 3 shares are sufficient to reconstruct the MASTER_SECRET and restore wallet access.
No single factor alone grants access. GripLock does not hold any shares.

---

## What happens if I lose one factor?

If one factor is lost (e.g., device is replaced), the remaining two factors are sufficient to reconstruct the MASTER_SECRET and restore access.

After recovery, the lost factor's share can be re-provisioned to a new device, passkey, or cloud account.

---

## What happens if I lose two or more factors?

If 2 or more factors are lost simultaneously, the MASTER_SECRET cannot be reconstructed.

Funds remain on-chain but may be inaccessible through GripLock.
There is no custodial recovery, master override, or support-assisted restoration.

This is why maintaining at least two independent factors is critical.

---

## What does NFC do?

NFC is used exclusively as a **physical intent gate**.

NFC tap initiates the session creation flow. It signals that the user is physically present and intends to interact with their wallet.

NFC does not:
- Perform any cryptographic operation
- Store or transmit keys, shares, or secrets
- Derive or reconstruct the MASTER_SECRET

NFC enforces physical presence. Authentication and key reconstruction happen separately through factor verification.

---

## Can I change my PIN or NFC device without losing my wallet?

Yes.

GripLock V2 supports **factor rotation**. You can change your PIN, secret, NFC device, or passkey without changing your wallet address.

Factor rotation re-encrypts the affected Shamir shares under new credentials. The underlying MASTER_SECRET and wallet address remain unchanged. No on-chain migration or fund movement is required.

---

## What is session key caching?

Session key caching allows GripLock to resume sessions faster without performing full Shamir share reconstruction each time.

When a valid session cache exists:
- The MASTER_SECRET does not need to be fully reconstructed from shares
- Session resumption is faster
- All authentication requirements are still enforced

Caching reduces latency, not security. Cached keys are encrypted and time-bounded. Cache invalidation occurs on session termination or timeout.

---

## Is GripLock a card issuer or payment service?

No.

GripLock does not issue cards, provide card programs, or operate as a payment processor.
NFC is used solely as a mechanism for physical intent enforcement.

---

## Is GripLock a mixer or privacy obfuscation tool?

No.

GripLock does not pool, reroute, or obfuscate transactions.
It does not hide balances or alter blockchain transparency.

Privacy is enforced by controlling **when and how interaction is possible**, not by modifying on-chain data.

---

## Are funds hidden from the blockchain?

No.

Funds always remain on-chain and verifiable.
GripLock does not remove, disguise, or mask blockchain data.

---

## Does GripLock provide anonymity?

No.

GripLock reduces interaction exposure.
It does not provide anonymity or unlinkability guarantees.

---

## What happens if my phone is lost?

If a device is lost:
- No active wallet session remains
- No signing capability exists
- Funds remain unaffected on-chain

The device share is one of three Shamir factors. If the remaining two factors (Google Drive and Passkey) are available, the MASTER_SECRET can be reconstructed and the device share re-provisioned to a new device.

---

## What happens if my NFC card is lost?

An NFC card alone does not grant access.

NFC serves as a physical intent gate. Loss of an NFC card does not compromise funds because NFC does not store keys, shares, or secrets.

A replacement NFC device can be configured without affecting the wallet or recovery factors.

---

## Can GripLock recover my wallet if I lose access?

No.

GripLock cannot recover wallets, reset access, or bypass security controls.
GripLock does not hold any shares or recovery data.

Recovery is only possible if the user retains access to at least 2 of their 3 Shamir share factors.

---

## Does GripLock support swaps?

Swaps may be supported as a **basic wallet capability**.

They are not a core product focus and are not treated as financial services or yield strategies.

---

## Can GripLock be automated or used with bots?

Not currently.

GripLock does not support background signing, automation, scheduled actions, or delegated execution today.

A future agent execution layer is being explored that would allow agent-initiated transactions within user-defined policy bounds, while preserving custody boundaries. This capability is experimental and not yet live.

---

## Is GripLock production-ready?

Only features listed under **What's Live** should be considered production-ready.

Anything labeled experimental may change, be removed, or never reach production.

---

## Why is GripLock designed this way?

GripLock prioritizes:
- Explicit user intent
- Reduced exposure
- Absence of always-on access
- Non-custodial architecture

These design choices trade convenience for control and security.

---

> **Summary**
> GripLock is designed to give users control over when their wallet exists and can be used.
> It reduces exposure by refusing to be always available — and never custodies anything.
