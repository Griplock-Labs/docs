# What is Griplock

Griplock is a privacy and control layer for crypto wallets, enforced through NFC-based physical intent.

It is designed to reduce unwanted exposure from public wallet interactions by making access, usage, and balance availability dependent on deliberate human action — not persistent software state.

Griplock does not replace blockchains, wallets, or on-chain logic.  
Funds always remain on-chain. Griplock changes **how** and **when** a wallet becomes usable.

## A Different Wallet Assumption

Most wallets assume constant availability.  
Once a wallet exists, it remains accessible, signable, and observable at all times.

Griplock challenges that assumption.

With Griplock, a wallet session only exists when the user explicitly creates it through physical intent.

No tap means no session.  
No session means no interaction.

## Physical Intent as a Security Primitive

At the core of Griplock is **physical intent**.

To activate a wallet session, a user must:
- Be physically present
- Tap an NFC card
- Confirm access locally

This removes reliance on:
- Always-on private keys
- Background signers
- Remote or automated triggers

A wallet session is created temporarily, used intentionally, and then disappears.

## Ephemeral by Design

Griplock wallets are ephemeral.

Keys are derived locally when needed and discarded after use.  
There is no persistent wallet state stored on Griplock servers.

There is:
- No background wallet
- No silent signer
- No long-lived session

A wallet exists only for the duration of user intent.
