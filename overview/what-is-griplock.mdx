# What is Griplock

Griplock is a privacy and control layer for crypto wallets, enforced through NFC-based physical intent.

It is designed to reduce unwanted exposure from public wallet interactions by making access, usage, and balance availability dependent on deliberate human action — not persistent software state.

Griplock does not replace blockchains, wallets, or on-chain logic.  
Funds always remain on-chain. Griplock changes **how** and **when** a wallet becomes usable.

## A Different Wallet Assumption

Most wallets assume constant availability.  
Once a wallet exists, it remains accessible, signable, and observable at all times.

Griplock challenges that assumption.

With Griplock, a wallet session only exists when the user explicitly creates it through physical intent.

No tap means no session.  
No session means no interaction.

## Physical Intent as a Security Primitive

At the core of Griplock is **physical intent**.

To activate a wallet session, a user must:
- Be physically present
- Tap an NFC card
- Confirm access locally

This removes reliance on:
- Always-on private keys
- Background signers
- Remote or automated triggers

A wallet session is created temporarily, used intentionally, and then disappears.

---

## Ephemeral by Design

Griplock wallets are ephemeral.

Keys are derived locally when needed and discarded after use.  
There is no persistent wallet state stored on Griplock servers.

There is:
- No background wallet
- No silent signer
- No long-lived session

A wallet exists only for the duration of user intent.

## What Griplock Is Designed For

Griplock is designed to:
- Reduce passive wallet tracking and attribution
- Limit automated or remote interaction risks
- Enforce explicit user intent before balances can be accessed
- Provide privacy without altering on-chain asset behavior

Privacy is enforced through **system behavior**, not UI masking or visual obfuscation.

---

## What Griplock Is Not

Griplock is **not**:
- A card issuer
- A bank or neobank
- A payment processor
- A mixer or obfuscation service
- A custodial wallet
- A financial institution

Griplock does not custody funds, hold balances, or execute transactions on behalf of users.

---

## Design Philosophy

Griplock optimizes for **intent**, not convenience.

Access is not assumed.  
Usage is not continuous.  
Visibility is not the default.

A wallet should exist only when the user explicitly wants it to exist.
