# Design Principles

Griplock is built around a small set of strict design principles.

These principles are not feature goals or marketing claims.  
They are intentional constraints that define what the system allows, what it refuses to do, and why certain trade-offs exist.

---

## Privacy by Default

Griplock assumes that wallet activity should not be continuously visible or interactable.

Balances, accounts, and interaction capability are not persistently exposed.  
They become usable only when the user explicitly initiates access.

Privacy is enforced at the **interaction layer**, not simulated through UI masking or visual obfuscation.

---

## Physical Intent Over Software Assumptions

Griplock introduces physical intent as a core security primitive.

A wallet session requires:
- Physical presence
- An NFC tap
- Local user confirmation

This removes reliance on:
- Always-on private keys
- Background signers
- Remote or automated triggers

If there is no physical action, there is no active wallet session.

---

## Ephemeral by Design

Griplock wallets are ephemeral by default.

Keys are derived locally when needed, used within an active session, and discarded afterward.  
There is no persistent wallet state stored on Griplock servers.

A wallet exists only for the duration of user intent.

---

## No Custody, No Trust

Griplock does not custody funds, keys, or balances.

The system is designed so that:
- Griplock cannot move funds
- Griplock cannot access balances
- Griplock cannot reconstruct wallets independently

Users retain full control and responsibility over their assets at all times.

---

## Reduced Attack Surface

By removing persistent access and background availability, Griplock reduces exposure to:
- Automated signing
- Remote exploitation
- Passive wallet scanning
- Session replay risks

Security is achieved by limiting **availability**, not by adding additional permissions or complexity.

---

## Explicit Trade-offs

Griplock prioritizes control and safety over convenience.

This means:
- Slower access compared to always-on wallets
- Physical interaction requirements
- No silent or automated usage

These trade-offs are deliberate and central to the system’s purpose.
