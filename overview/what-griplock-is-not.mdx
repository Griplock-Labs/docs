Griplock is intentionally narrow in scope.

This page defines clear boundaries around what Griplock does **not** do, in order to avoid ambiguity, misinterpretation, or incorrect assumptions about the system.

---

## Not a Custodial Wallet

Griplock is not a custodial wallet.

The system does not:

- Hold private keys
- Control user funds
- Execute transactions on behalf of users
- Recover wallets independently

Users retain full ownership and responsibility over their assets at all times.

---

## Not a Mixer or Obfuscation Service

Griplock is not a mixer, tumbler, or obfuscation protocol.

Funds are not pooled, rerouted, or hidden from the blockchain.\
All assets remain fully on-chain and verifiable.

Griplock enforces privacy through **controlled interaction**, not through transaction manipulation or on-chain obfuscation.

---

## Not a Privacy Illusion

Griplock does not claim to make users anonymous.

It does not:

- Hide funds from the blockchain
- Alter transaction history
- Bypass network-level transparency

Griplock reduces exposure by limiting **when and how** a wallet can be interacted with, not by changing how blockchains work.

---

## Not a DeFi Super App

Griplock is not a DeFi aggregator or yield-focused financial application.

It is not designed to optimize returns, bundle financial strategies, or act as a full-service DeFi platform.

While certain on-chain interactions such as swaps may be supported, they are treated as **basic wallet capabilities**, not as core product offerings or financial products.

Any non-core functionality is clearly scoped, optional, and not central to Griplock’s primary role as a privacy and control layer.

---

## Not a Financial Institution

Griplock is not:

- A bank or neobank
- A licensed financial institution
- A payment processor
- A money service business

Griplock does not offer financial services, hold customer funds, or act as an intermediary between users and the blockchain.

---

## Not a Card Issuer

Griplock does not issue physical or virtual cards.

Any use of NFC cards within Griplock is limited to **local authentication and physical intent enforcement**.\
Griplock does not provide card programs, card balances, or card-linked accounts.

---

## Clear Responsibility Model

Griplock provides a system for enforcing user intent.

It does not remove user responsibility, decision-making, or risk.\
Security and privacy depend on correct usage of the system and the user’s own operational practices.

---

> **Summary**\
> Griplock is a privacy and control layer, not a financial service or financial institution.\
> Its role is to enforce intent and reduce exposure — nothing more, nothing less.
