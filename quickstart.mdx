# Quickstart Guide

This guide walks you through setting up and using GRIPLOCK for the first time.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="GRIPLOCK-Compatible NFC Card">
    Any NFC card with a unique UID (ISO 14443A/B compliant). This includes most modern contactless cards.
  </Step>
  <Step title="GRIPLOCK Mobile App">
    Available for iOS and Android. The app reads NFC cards and establishes secure connections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modern Web Browser">
    Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge with WebRTC support enabled.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## First-Time Setup

### Step 1: Access the Dashboard

Navigate to the GRIPLOCK dashboard in your web browser:

```
https://app.griplock.io
```

You'll see a QR code displayed on the login screen. This QR code contains:

- A compressed WebRTC offer
- The dashboard's public key for encryption
- A unique session identifier
- WebSocket signaling server URL

### Step 2: Scan with Mobile App

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS">
    1. Open the GRIPLOCK app
    2. Tap **Scan QR Code**
    3. Point your camera at the dashboard QR code
    4. The app will parse the connection details automatically
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android">
    1. Open the GRIPLOCK app
    2. Tap **Scan to Connect**
    3. Allow camera permissions if prompted
    4. Scan the QR code on your dashboard
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Tap Your NFC Card

Once connected, the app will prompt you to tap your NFC card:

1. Hold your NFC card against the back of your phone
2. Wait for the "Card Detected" confirmation
3. The app reads the card's unique identifier (UID)

<Warning>
  **Keep your card secure!** The NFC card UID is one of two factors required to derive your wallet. While the UID alone cannot access your funds, treat it with the same care as any authentication token.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Enter Your PIN

After card detection, enter your personal PIN:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│     Enter Your PIN          │
│                             │
│       ● ● ● ●               │
│                             │
│   This PIN + your NFC card  │
│   derive your wallet.       │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

<Info>
  **Choose a strong PIN.** Your PIN is never stored anywhere—you must remember it. If you forget your PIN, you'll need to create a new wallet with a new PIN.
</Info>

### Step 5: Access Your Wallet

Upon successful authentication, the dashboard displays:

- **Solana Address** — Your deterministically derived wallet address
- **SOL Balance** — Current balance in SOL
- **Token Holdings** — SPL tokens held in the wallet
- **Transaction History** — Recent on-chain activity

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="QR Code Not Scanning">
    Ensure adequate lighting and hold your phone steady. The QR code contains compressed data and requires a clear capture.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="NFC Card Not Detected">
    - Check that NFC is enabled on your device
    - Remove any phone case that may block NFC
    - Try positioning the card at different angles
    - Some phones have NFC sensors at specific locations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection Failed">
    - Verify both devices have internet connectivity
    - Check that WebRTC is not blocked by firewall
    - Try refreshing the dashboard for a new QR code
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Session Expired Unexpectedly">
    Sessions expire after 15 minutes of inactivity. Any user interaction resets this timer. If sessions expire too quickly, ensure you're actively using the dashboard.
