Griplock introduces a shielded interaction model that separates **fund existence** from **fund usability**.

Funds always remain on-chain.  
What Griplock controls is **when and how** those funds become interactable.

This page describes how shielded interactions work from receiving funds to unshielding them through explicit user intent.

---

## Shielded by Default

When funds are received through a Griplock-enabled wallet flow, they are treated as **shielded** by default.

Shielded means:
- Funds exist on-chain
- Ownership is preserved
- Interaction capability is restricted

Balances are not immediately exposed for use until the user explicitly initiates access through a wallet session.

---

## Receiving Funds

Receiving funds does not require an active wallet session.

Funds can be sent to a Griplock-derived address at any time.  
They remain on-chain and verifiable, but **inactive** from an interaction standpoint.

No signing capability exists until the user creates a wallet session through physical intent.

---

## Interaction Requires an Active Session

To interact with shielded funds, the user must:
- Create a wallet session via NFC and local confirmation
- Explicitly unlock interaction capability

Without an active session:
- Funds cannot be moved
- Transactions cannot be signed
- On-chain actions cannot be initiated

Shielding is enforced by the system, not by UI state.

---

## Unshielding by Intent

Unshielding is not automatic.

It occurs only when the user:
- Is physically present
- Creates an active wallet session
- Confirms the intended interaction locally

Unshielding enables temporary access to balances for the purpose of a specific action.

Once the session ends, funds return to a shielded, non-interactable state.

---

## Session-Bound Interaction

All interactions with shielded funds are:
- Bound to the active wallet session
- Time-limited
- Non-persistent

There is no background access and no lingering signing capability once the session ends.

---

## What Shielding Does and Does Not Do

Shielding does:
- Reduce passive wallet exposure
- Limit unintended or automated interaction
- Enforce explicit user intent before usage

Shielding does not:
- Remove funds from the blockchain
- Hide transaction history
- Obfuscate on-chain data
- Pool or reroute assets

Griplock does not alter blockchain transparency.  
It alters **interaction availability**.

## Security and Privacy Implications

By decoupling receipt from interaction, Griplock:
- Reduces attack surface during idle periods
- Prevents background signing
- Limits exposure to wallet probing and automation

Privacy is achieved through **controlled access**, not through obfuscation.

> **Summary**  
> In Griplock, funds can exist without being usable.  
> Interaction is unlocked only by explicit, physical user intent — and only for the duration of a session.
