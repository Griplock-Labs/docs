GripLock introduces a shielded interaction model that separates **fund existence** from **fund usability**.

Funds always remain on-chain.
What GripLock controls is **when and how** those funds become interactable — through session-bound access governed by physical intent and auth policy.

This page describes how shielded interactions work from receiving funds to unlocking them through explicit user action.

---

## Shielded by Default

When funds are received through a GripLock-enabled wallet flow, they are treated as **shielded** by default.

Shielded means:
- Funds exist on-chain
- Ownership is preserved
- Interaction capability is restricted

Balances are not immediately exposed for use until the user explicitly initiates access through a wallet session.

---

## Receiving Funds

Receiving funds does not require an active wallet session.

Funds can be sent to a GripLock-derived address at any time.
They remain on-chain and verifiable, but **inactive** from an interaction standpoint.

No signing capability exists until the user creates a wallet session through physical intent and auth policy satisfaction.

---

## The Unlock Flow

To interact with shielded funds, the user must complete the full unlock sequence:

1. **NFC Tap** — physical intent gate confirms the user is present
2. **Auth Policy** — Passkey OR PIN/Secret (based on configured auth level) confirms identity
3. **Reconstruct or Cache** — `MASTER_SECRET` is either reconstructed from 2-of-3 Shamir shares or decrypted from the short-lived session cache
4. **Sign** — the reconstructed key material is used to authorize on-chain actions

Each step is mandatory. Skipping any step prevents interaction.

---

## Session-Bound Signing

All signing operations are bound to the active wallet session.

Once `MASTER_SECRET` is available in memory:
- A session key is derived and cached in Device SecureStore
- Subsequent signing operations use the cached session key
- No share reconstruction is required for repeated operations within the same session

Signing is:
- Time-limited to the session duration
- Non-persistent beyond session termination
- Impossible without prior NFC tap and auth policy satisfaction

There is no background signer. There is no queued or deferred signing.

---

## Automatic Re-Shielding on Session End

When a wallet session terminates:
- The cached session key is discarded
- `MASTER_SECRET` is cleared from memory
- Signing capability is immediately revoked
- Funds return to a **shielded, non-interactable state**

Re-shielding is automatic. The user does not need to take any action to restore the shielded state.

To interact again, the full unlock flow must be repeated from the beginning.

---

## What Shielding Does and Does Not Do

Shielding does:
- Reduce passive wallet exposure
- Limit unintended or automated interaction
- Enforce explicit user intent before usage
- Automatically restore protection on session end

Shielding does not:
- Remove funds from the blockchain
- Hide transaction history
- Obfuscate on-chain data
- Pool or reroute assets

GripLock does not alter blockchain transparency.
It alters **interaction availability**.

---

## Security and Privacy Implications

By decoupling receipt from interaction, GripLock:
- Reduces attack surface during idle periods
- Prevents background signing
- Limits exposure to wallet probing and automation
- Ensures key material exists only within intentional sessions

No key material persists outside of an active session. No remote process can initiate signing. No background task can access shielded funds.

Privacy is achieved through **controlled access**, not through obfuscation.

---

> **Summary**
> In GripLock, funds can exist without being usable.
> Interaction is unlocked only through the full sequence: NFC tap, auth policy, key reconstruction — and only for the duration of a session.
> When the session ends, funds automatically return to a shielded state. GripLock never custodies keys or funds.
