Griplock wallets do not exist permanently.

Instead of maintaining a persistent wallet state, Griplock creates **temporary wallet sessions** that exist only for the duration of explicit user intent.

This page describes how a wallet session is created, used, and terminated.

---

## 1. Session Creation

A wallet session begins only when the user explicitly initiates access.

To create a session, the user must:
- Be physically present
- Tap an NFC card
- Confirm access locally on their device

Only after these conditions are met does the system derive the necessary cryptographic material locally.

If any step is missing, the session is not created.

---

## 2. Local Key Derivation

Once a session is authorized, cryptographic keys are derived **locally** on the user’s device.

Key derivation:
- Happens only during an active session
- Does not rely on persistent storage
- Does not transmit private keys to Griplock servers

Derived keys exist only in memory and only for the duration of the session.

---

## 3. Active Session State

While a wallet session is active:
- Balances may become accessible
- Transactions may be constructed and signed
- On-chain interactions may be initiated

All actions are bound to the active session.  
There is no background signer and no autonomous execution.

---

## 4. Session Termination

A wallet session ends when:
- The user explicitly exits the session
- The application is closed
- The session times out
- Local security conditions are violated

When a session terminates:
- Derived keys are discarded from memory
- Signing capability is removed
- The wallet becomes inaccessible again

---

## 5. Post-Session State

After termination:
- No wallet session exists
- No keys remain in memory
- No balances are accessible
- No transactions can be signed

To regain access, the user must re-initiate the full session creation process.

---

## Security Implications

By limiting wallet existence to explicit sessions, Griplock reduces exposure to:
- Remote exploitation
- Background signing
- Long-lived key compromise
- Passive wallet interaction

Security is enforced through **absence**, not persistence.

> **Summary**  
> A Griplock wallet session is created intentionally, exists temporarily, and is destroyed completely.  
> Wallet access is an event — not a constant state.
