# Physical Intent (NFC)

Griplock uses NFC as a mechanism to enforce **physical intent**.

Physical intent means that wallet access and interaction require deliberate, real-world user action — not just software execution or remote input.

This introduces a human-in-the-loop constraint that cannot be replicated by background processes, bots, or remote attackers.

## Why Physical Intent Matters

Most wallet systems rely entirely on software-based assumptions.

If a private key exists in memory or storage, it can be:
- Triggered remotely
- Accessed by malware
- Used by automated scripts
- Exploited without the user’s awareness

Griplock changes this model by requiring **physical presence** before a wallet session can exist.

## NFC as an Intent Gate

In Griplock, NFC is not used for payments or card programs.

It is used as an **intent gate**.

To activate a wallet session, a user must:
- Be physically present
- Tap an NFC card
- Confirm access locally on their device

Without this physical action, the system refuses to create a wallet session.

---

## Why NFC (and Not Biometrics Alone)

Biometrics and PINs prove identity.  
They do not prove presence.

NFC introduces a second dimension:
- Something the user physically has
- Something that must be consciously presented

This reduces exposure to:
- Remote compromise
- Background signing
- Silent wallet activation

NFC ensures that access is intentional, observable, and interruptible by the user.

---

## No NFC, No Session

If there is no NFC interaction:
- No wallet session is created
- No keys are derived
- No balances become accessible
- No transactions can be initiated

Physical intent is not an added security layer.  
It is a **precondition** for wallet existence.

---

## Scope and Limitations

NFC in Griplock does not:
- Store private keys
- Contain balances
- Act as a payment instrument

It is a local signal used solely to authorize the creation of a wallet session.

Loss or replacement of an NFC card does not grant access on its own.  
Additional local confirmation is always required.

> **Summary**  
> NFC in Griplock is not about cards or payments.  
> It is about enforcing human intent before a wallet can exist.
