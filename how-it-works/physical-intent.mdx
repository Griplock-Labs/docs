GripLock uses NFC as a mechanism to enforce **physical intent**.

Physical intent means that wallet access and interaction require deliberate, real-world user action — not just software execution or remote input.

This introduces a human-in-the-loop constraint that cannot be replicated by background processes, bots, or remote attackers.

---

## Why Physical Intent Matters

Most wallet systems rely entirely on software-based assumptions.

If a private key exists in memory or storage, it can be:
- Triggered remotely
- Accessed by malware
- Used by automated scripts
- Exploited without the user's awareness

GripLock changes this model by requiring **physical presence** before a wallet session can exist.

## NFC as a Pure Intent Gate

In GripLock V2, the NFC card serves one purpose: **physical intent gating**.

NFC is not used for payments, card programs, key derivation, or encryption.

To activate a wallet session, a user must:
- Be physically present
- Tap an NFC card
- Satisfy the required auth policy (Passkey, PIN, or Secret)

Without this physical action, the system refuses to create a wallet session.

The NFC UID is read during the tap and used strictly for non-cryptographic purposes.

---

## What NFC UID Is Used For

The NFC UID serves a narrow, well-defined role:

- **Intent gating** — confirming the user has tapped a physical card
- **Session confirmation** — validating that the correct card is present
- **Pairing metadata** — associating a card with a device during provisioning
- **Metadata hash storage** — anchoring non-secret metadata to the card identity

These are all **policy-layer** functions. They confirm presence and intent. They do not touch cryptographic material.

---

## What NFC UID Is Never Used For

The NFC UID is **never** used to:

- Derive wallet keys or `K_user`
- Encrypt or decrypt Shamir shares
- Contribute entropy to `MASTER_SECRET`
- Participate in any cryptographic operation

Wallet root material is generated from a secure random source (`SecureRandom(32 bytes)`), entirely independent of the NFC UID.

This separation ensures that physical card compromise does not expose cryptographic material.

---

## Why NFC (and Not Biometrics Alone)

Biometrics and PINs prove identity.
They do not prove presence.

NFC introduces a second dimension:
- Something the user physically has
- Something that must be consciously presented

This reduces exposure to:
- Remote compromise
- Background signing
- Silent wallet activation

NFC ensures that access is intentional, observable, and interruptible by the user.

---

## No NFC, No Session

If there is no NFC interaction:
- No wallet session is created
- No keys are reconstructed or cached
- No balances become accessible
- No transactions can be initiated

Physical intent is not an added security layer.
It is a **precondition** for wallet existence.

---

## Scope and Limitations

NFC in GripLock does not:
- Store private keys or Shamir shares
- Contain balances
- Act as a payment instrument
- Contribute to key derivation or encryption

It is a local signal used solely to authorize the creation of a wallet session.

Loss or replacement of an NFC card does not grant access on its own.
Additional auth policy satisfaction (Passkey, PIN, or Secret) is always required.

---

> **Summary**
> NFC in GripLock is not about cards or payments.
> It is about enforcing human intent before a wallet can exist.
> The NFC UID is never used for key derivation or encryption — it is a pure intent gate.
