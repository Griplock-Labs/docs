This page outlines the **current areas of focus** for GripLock.

It is not a product roadmap and does not represent commitments, timelines, or guaranteed feature delivery.
All areas described here are subject to change as the system evolves.

---

## Execution Policy Layer

GripLock is exploring per-wallet policy definitions that govern what actions a wallet session can perform.

This includes:
- Maximum transaction value limits
- Allowed programs and contract restrictions
- Time-window-based access controls
- Policy-scoped transaction authorization

Execution policies would operate as a layer above session-based signing, adding granular control over what is permitted within a session.

---

## Human Intent Gating at Scale

NFC-based physical intent is being refined for broader operational coverage.

Areas of focus include:
- NFC tap as physical authorization for high-value or sensitive operations
- Tiered intent requirements based on transaction risk
- Consistent intent gating across expanded capabilities
- Maintaining physical presence as a security boundary at scale

Intent gating ensures that critical operations always require conscious user action.

---

## Agent Execution Compatibility

GripLock is exploring support for agent-initiated transactions that operate within user-defined policy bounds.

This includes:
- Agents executing transactions on behalf of the user
- Execution constrained by wallet-level policies
- Agents operating without custody of keys or MASTER_SECRET
- User-defined boundaries and revocation controls

The core principle is preserved: agents execute but never custody. The user retains control over policy definitions and can revoke agent access at any time.

---

## Programmable Authorization

Conditional authorization rules are being explored as an extension to the session and policy model.

This includes:
- Multi-sig-like approval flows
- Conditional rules based on transaction parameters (value, destination, program)
- Tiered authorization for different operation types
- Configurable approval requirements per wallet or per action

Programmable authorization would layer on top of the existing intent model, not replace it.

---

## Multi-Wallet and Multi-Chain Expansion

GripLock is exploring the ability to manage multiple wallets and support additional chains.

This includes:
- Multiple wallets derived from the same MASTER_SECRET root
- Cross-chain support for additional networks
- Unified recovery across wallets and chains using the same 2-of-3 Shamir threshold
- Consistent security model regardless of chain

Multi-wallet and multi-chain support would not alter the core security model or custody boundaries.

---

## Autonomous Workflow Infrastructure

Scheduled and recurring operations within policy bounds are under exploration.

This includes:
- Recurring transactions within pre-defined limits
- Scheduled operations that execute without real-time user presence
- Policy-gated automation that respects custody boundaries
- Explicit user opt-in and configuration before any automated execution

Autonomous workflows would never bypass custody boundaries or operate outside of user-defined policy.

---

## Custody Boundary Preservation

As capabilities expand, preserving custody boundaries remains a non-negotiable focus.

This includes:
- Ensuring agents execute but never custody
- Maintaining user control over all policy definitions
- Preventing any external system from holding keys, shares, or MASTER_SECRET
- Validating that new capabilities do not erode the core security model

Every expansion of capability must be evaluated against custody boundary preservation before adoption.

---

## Refining the Core Experience

GripLock's ongoing focus includes strengthening its core interaction model.

This includes:
- Improving session reliability and performance
- Hardening NFC-based physical intent flows
- Optimizing session key caching
- Reducing friction without compromising security boundaries

Any improvements must remain aligned with GripLock's design principles.

---

## Security Review and Testing

Security work is continuous and iterative.

This includes:
- Internal review of session boundaries and Shamir share handling
- Validation of key lifecycle behavior and MASTER_SECRET reconstruction
- Testing failure, interruption, and factor-loss scenarios
- Review of AEAD encryption and KDF parameter choices

Security improvements are treated as ongoing work, not one-time milestones.

---

## What This Page Is Not

This page is not:
- A feature announcement
- A delivery schedule
- A promise of future functionality

GripLock will only ship functionality that aligns with its core principles and security assumptions.
