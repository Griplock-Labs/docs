This page outlines the **current areas of focus** for Griplock.

It is not a product roadmap and does not represent commitments, timelines, or guaranteed feature delivery.  
All areas described here are subject to change as the system evolves.

---

## Refining the Core Experience

Griplock’s primary focus remains on strengthening its core interaction model.

This includes:
- Improving session reliability and performance
- Hardening NFC-based physical intent flows
- Reducing friction without compromising security boundaries

Any improvements must remain aligned with Griplock’s design principles.

---

## Privacy Model Hardening

Ongoing work focuses on refining how privacy is enforced at the interaction level.

Areas of attention include:
- Edge-case handling for shielded balances
- Clearer separation between receipt and interaction
- Improved session-bound privacy guarantees

The goal is consistency and predictability, not expanded surface area.

---

## Mobile Experience and Usability

Griplock prioritizes a stable and intentional mobile experience.

Focus areas include:
- Session clarity and feedback
- Error handling and recovery flows
- Clear signaling of session state and intent boundaries

Usability improvements will not introduce background access or automation.

---

## Security Review and Testing

Security work is continuous and iterative.

This includes:
- Internal review of session boundaries
- Validation of key lifecycle behavior
- Testing failure and interruption scenarios

Security improvements are treated as ongoing work, not one-time milestones.

---

## Exploratory Research

Some areas may be explored without commitment to production deployment.

These may include:
- Alternative intent confirmation mechanisms
- Additional privacy-preserving interaction patterns
- Controlled experimentation with non-core capabilities

Exploration does not imply roadmap inclusion.

---

## What This Page Is Not

This page is not:
- A feature announcement
- A delivery schedule
- A promise of future functionality

Griplock will only ship functionality that aligns with its core principles and security assumptions.
