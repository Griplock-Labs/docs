# Product Roadmap

Griplock is built around a single idea:  
**wallet interaction should only exist when a human explicitly intends it**.

The roadmap below shows how intent enforcement, privacy, and authentication strength evolve across the product.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Intent Foundation

This phase establishes reliable human intent enforcement.

- NFC-based physical intent confirmation  
- PIN-based local verification  
- Ephemeral wallet session lifecycle (spawn → use → destroy)  
- Private Receive as the default state  
- Explicit unlock / unshield flows  
- Clear session state visibility  
- Session boundary security testing  

---

## Phase 2 — Intent-Driven Wallet Actions

Intent enforcement expands into core wallet interactions.

- Private Send (intent-gated)  
- Private Swap (intent-gated)  
- Session-scoped permissions  
- Removal of persistent approvals  
- Error handling & recovery UX  
- Intent visibility during active sessions  

---

## Phase 3 — User-Selectable Authentication & Intent Models

Authentication becomes stronger, flexible, and configurable by the user.

- User-selectable authentication combinations  
- Supported authentication flows:
  - NFC + PIN  
  - NFC + Secret  
  - NFC + PIN + Secret  
- Authentication strength profiles per user  
- Session binding to the selected authentication model  
- Recovery and fallback flows for authentication factors  

---

## Phase 4 — Micropayment & Access Control Research (x402)

This phase explores intent enforcement for per-request payment systems.

- Intent-gated x402 payment flow research  
- Ephemeral payer wallet patterns  
- Client-side payment confirmation hooks  
- Verification and trust layer experiments  
- Internal prototypes and technical documentation  

---

## Phase 5 — Human ↔ Agent Boundary Controls

As automation increases, clear boundaries between humans and agents become critical.

- Agent-initiated request gating  
- Human-in-the-loop approval flows  
- Intent policies for delegated actions  
- Controlled pilot testing  
- Extensible intent confirmation patterns
