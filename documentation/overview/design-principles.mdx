GripLock's architecture is guided by a set of non-negotiable design principles.

These principles inform every technical decision — from key derivation to session management to recovery.

---

## 1. Physical Intent Required

Every wallet session must begin with a deliberate physical action.

- NFC card tap is the only way to initiate a session
- No remote, background, or automated access is possible
- The physical requirement is enforced at the protocol level, not as a UI preference

If you didn't tap, nothing happens.

---

## 2. Non-Custodial Absolute

GripLock never custodies funds, keys, shares, or recovery data.

- All cryptographic material is generated and processed on-device
- Encrypted shares are stored by the user (Google Drive, device, Passkey)
- GripLock servers have zero access to unencrypted key material
- There is no GripLock-side recovery, override, or admin access

The user is the sole custodian. This is not configurable.

---

## 3. Keys Exist Only When Needed

The wallet's MASTER_SECRET is reconstructed only during an active session and destroyed immediately after.

- Outside a session, the key does not exist in any usable form on any device
- Session keys are short-lived and cached only in the device's secure enclave
- Session termination triggers immediate key material cleanup
- No persistent plaintext key storage anywhere in the system

Exposure window is minimized by design.

---

## 4. Threshold Over Single Point of Failure

Recovery and access use Shamir 2-of-3 threshold sharing instead of a single seed phrase or master password.

- Three independent shares across three independent storage locations
- Any 2 of 3 shares reconstruct the MASTER_SECRET
- Losing one factor is recoverable
- No single point of compromise or loss can destroy access

Resilience through distribution.

---

## 5. Factors Are Replaceable

User credentials (PIN, Secret, NFC card) can be rotated without changing the wallet address.

- Changing your PIN re-encrypts Share A with a new K_user
- Replacing your NFC card updates the pairing metadata
- The MASTER_SECRET and wallet address remain unchanged
- No migration, no new wallet, no fund transfer needed

Identity is bound to the key, not to the credentials.

---

## 6. Memory-Hard Cryptography

All key derivation uses memory-hard algorithms resistant to brute-force attacks.

- Argon2id with 64 MiB memory, 3 iterations as the primary KDF
- scrypt as a fallback where Argon2id is unavailable
- SHA-256 is never used for key derivation — only for non-secret fingerprints
- All encryption uses AEAD (authenticated encryption) — no bare ciphers

Crypto choices are conservative and well-established.

---

## 7. Privacy Is Structural

Privacy is enforced by architecture, not by policy or promises.

- No user accounts or profiles on GripLock servers
- No KYC, no email, no identity linking
- No transaction logs stored by GripLock
- Wallet activity is visible only on-chain, never to GripLock

If the data doesn't exist, it can't be leaked, subpoenaed, or sold.

---

## 8. Separation of Concerns

Each component in the system has a single, well-defined role:

| Component | Role | Not Used For |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **NFC UID** | Physical intent gate | Key derivation, encryption |
| **PIN/Secret** | Policy unlock (K_user derivation) | Wallet generation |
| **Passkey** | Auth factor + recovery share wrapper | Key derivation |
| **Secure Enclave** | K_dev generation + Share B encryption | User-facing auth |
| **Google Drive** | Encrypted Share A storage | Key management |

No component exceeds its defined scope.

---

## 9. Fail Closed

When in doubt, GripLock denies access rather than granting it.

- Missing NFC tap → no session
- Failed authentication → no key reconstruction
- Expired session → key material destroyed
- Corrupted share → reconstruction fails, no partial access

There is no degraded mode that weakens security.

---

## 10. No Custody Creep

As GripLock evolves (execution policies, agent compatibility, multi-chain), the custody boundary is preserved.

- Future features execute within user-defined policy bounds
- Agents may initiate transactions but never custody keys
- Multi-wallet and multi-chain expansion follows the same non-custodial model
- The user always retains final authority

Convenience features will never compromise the custody model.

---

> **Summary**
> GripLock's design principles: physical intent required, absolute non-custody, keys exist only when needed, threshold recovery, replaceable factors, memory-hard crypto, structural privacy, separation of concerns, fail-closed behavior, and no custody creep — ever.
