$GRIP is the Griplock token with an associated contract address.

This page describes the token’s current role only.  
It does not describe future mechanics or speculative utility.

---

## Token Existence

Griplock has a token named $GRIP deployed on-chain.

The existence of the token does not affect how the Griplock system operates.

---

## Product Independence

$GRIP is not required to use Griplock.

All core functionality works independently of the token.  
Wallet sessions, privacy controls, and signing behavior do not rely on token ownership or usage.

Users do not need to hold, spend, or stake $GRIP to use the product.

---

## Current Role

At this time, $GRIP exists at the project level, not as part of the protocol runtime.

The token is used for project alignment and development sustainability rather than as a system component.

---

## No Product Gating

Holding or not holding $GRIP does not unlock features or change product behavior.

Privacy features, wallet sessions, and security boundaries remain the same regardless of token ownership.

Griplock is intentionally designed to be token-agnostic.

---

## No Protocol Utility Today

There is currently no on-chain utility for $GRIP in the core Griplock system.

The token is not used for fees, access control, governance, staking, or rewards.

---

## Separation From Runtime Logic

$GRIP is not involved in runtime processes.

Session creation, key derivation, shielding behavior, and transaction signing all function without any token interaction.
