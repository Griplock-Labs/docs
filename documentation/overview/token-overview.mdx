$GRIP is the Griplock token with an associated contract address.

This page describes the token’s **current role only**, without referencing future mechanics or speculative utility.

---

## Token Existence

Griplock has a token named $GRIP deployed on-chain.

The existence of the token does not affect how the Griplock system operates.

---

## Product Independence

$GRIP is not required to use Griplock.

All core functionality — including wallet sessions, privacy controls, and signing flows — works independently of the token.

Users do not need to hold, spend, or stake $GRIP to use the product.

---

## Current Role

At this time, $GRIP exists at the project level, not as part of the protocol runtime.

The token is used for project alignment and development sustainability, rather than as a system component.

---

## No Product Gating

Holding or not holding $GRIP does not:
- Unlock features
- Enable privacy modes
- Affect wallet sessions
- Change security behavior

The Griplock system is intentionally token-agnostic.

---

## No Protocol Utility Today

There is no on-chain utility for $GRIP in the core Griplock system today.

The token is not used for:
- Fees
- Access control
- Governance
- Staking or rewards

---

## Separation From Runtime Logic

$GRIP is not involved in:
- Session creation
- Key derivation
- Shielding or unshielding
- Transaction signing

All runtime behavior functions without token interaction.

> **Summary**  
> $GRIP exists on-chain but is not required to use Griplock.  
> The system operates independently of the token.
