Understanding what GripLock is not is as important as understanding what it is.

This page clarifies common misconceptions and draws clear boundaries around GripLock's scope and responsibilities.

---

## GripLock Is Not a Custodial Wallet

GripLock never holds, stores, or has access to user funds or private keys.

- MASTER_SECRET is generated on-device and split into encrypted shares
- Shares are stored by the user across their own storage (Google Drive, device, Passkey)
- GripLock servers cannot reconstruct, access, or freeze user wallets
- There is no "GripLock vault" or centralized key store

If GripLock ceases to exist, your shares and wallet remain fully functional.

---

## GripLock Is Not an Exchange

GripLock does not facilitate trading, market-making, or order matching.

- No order books
- No liquidity pools operated by GripLock
- No fiat on/off ramp services managed by GripLock
- No price feeds or trading interfaces

GripLock is a wallet access layer, not a trading platform.

---

## GripLock Is Not a Blockchain

GripLock does not operate its own chain, consensus mechanism, or validator network.

- No native blockchain
- No gas token requirement
- No on-chain protocol governance

GripLock operates as a client-side security layer on top of existing blockchains.

---

## GripLock Is Not an Always-On Wallet

Unlike most wallets, GripLock is intentionally not always available.

- The wallet's signing capability only exists during an active session
- Sessions require physical NFC tap + authentication
- Outside a session, the MASTER_SECRET does not exist in memory
- There is no background process that can sign transactions

This is a feature, not a limitation.

---

## GripLock Is Not a Seed Phrase Wallet

GripLock V2 does not use mnemonic seed phrases.

- No 12 or 24 word recovery phrase
- No BIP-39 word list
- Recovery uses Shamir 2-of-3 threshold sharing instead
- Nothing to write down, photograph, or store in a safe

---

## GripLock Does Not Process Transactions

GripLock signs transactions locally during a session. It does not:

- Submit transactions to the blockchain on behalf of users
- Batch, sequence, or prioritize transactions
- Act as a relayer or transaction processor
- Store transaction history on GripLock servers

The signed transaction is handed to the user's chosen RPC endpoint or dApp.

---

## GripLock Does Not Store User Data

GripLock does not maintain user accounts, profiles, or data on its servers.

- No email addresses or personal information collected
- No KYC or identity verification
- No analytics tied to wallet addresses
- No transaction logs stored by GripLock

Privacy is structural, not policy-based.

---

## GripLock Does Not Offer Custodial Recovery

If a user loses 2 or more of their 3 recovery factors, GripLock cannot recover their wallet.

- There is no "forgot password" flow that contacts GripLock
- There is no admin override or master key
- There is no support ticket that can restore access
- Recovery is entirely user-controlled through threshold reconstruction

This is the trade-off of true non-custodial design.

---

> **Summary**
> GripLock is not a custodial wallet, exchange, blockchain, always-on wallet, seed phrase wallet, transaction processor, data store, or custodial recovery service. It is a non-custodial, session-based wallet access layer that enforces physical intent.
