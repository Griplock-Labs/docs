GripLock is a non-custodial DeFi wallet that enforces physical intent for every transaction.

It combines NFC card authentication with threshold cryptography to create a wallet that only works when you physically choose to use it.

## Core Concept

GripLock creates a wallet session only when the user taps their NFC card and confirms their identity. Outside of a session, the wallet's private key does not exist in any usable form.

- No always-on access
- No background signing
- No remote authorization

Every interaction with your funds requires deliberate, physical action.

## How It Works (Summary)

1. **Wallet Creation** — A random 32-byte MASTER_SECRET is generated and split into 3 shares using Shamir secret sharing
2. **Share Distribution** — Shares are encrypted and stored across Google Drive, the device, and a Passkey backup
3. **Session Creation** — Tap your NFC card + authenticate (PIN, Secret, or Passkey) to reconstruct the key temporarily
4. **Transaction Signing** — Sign transactions during the active session
5. **Session End** — Key material is wiped from memory. The wallet returns to a shielded state

## What Makes It Different

| Feature | Traditional Wallet | GripLock |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **Key Storage** | Always available on device | Split across 3 locations, reconstructed on demand |
| **Access Model** | Software unlock (password/biometric) | Physical NFC tap + authentication |
| **Recovery** | Seed phrase (single point of failure) | 2-of-3 threshold recovery (no seed phrase) |
| **Background Access** | Possible | Impossible — requires physical card |
| **Factor Rotation** | Usually changes wallet address | PIN/Secret/NFC changeable without affecting wallet |

## Non-Custodial by Design

GripLock does not custody funds, private keys, or recovery data.

- MASTER_SECRET is generated on-device and never transmitted
- Shares are encrypted before leaving the device
- GripLock servers never see unencrypted key material
- Recovery is user-controlled through threshold reconstruction

The user is the sole custodian at all times.

## Who It's For

GripLock is designed for users who want:

- Physical control over when their wallet is active
- Protection against remote attacks, malware, and unauthorized access
- Recovery options that don't depend on memorizing a seed phrase
- A wallet that cannot sign transactions without their physical presence

> **Summary**
> GripLock is a non-custodial DeFi wallet that uses NFC-based physical intent, threshold cryptography, and session-based access to give users complete control over their funds — with no always-on exposure.
