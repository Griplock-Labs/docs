This page describes functionality that exists in **experimental, exploratory, or non-production** form.

Features listed here may change, be removed, or never reach production.
They should not be relied upon for long-term usage or guarantees.

---

## Execution Policy Layer

Per-wallet policy definitions are under exploration.

This includes:
- Maximum transaction value limits
- Allowed program and contract restrictions
- Time-window-based access controls
- Policy-scoped transaction authorization

Execution policies would define boundaries for what a wallet session can do, independent of the user's signing capability.

---

## Agent-Initiated Transactions

Support for agent-initiated transactions within policy bounds is being explored.

This includes:
- Agents executing transactions on behalf of the user
- Execution constrained by wallet-level policies
- Agents operating without custody of keys or MASTER_SECRET
- User-defined boundaries for agent behavior

Agents would execute but never custody. The user retains full control over policy definitions and can revoke agent access at any time.

---

## Multi-Chain Expansion

Expansion beyond the current chain is under consideration.

This includes:
- Multiple wallets derived from the same MASTER_SECRET root
- Cross-chain support for additional networks
- Unified recovery across chains using the same 2-of-3 Shamir threshold

Multi-chain support would not alter the core security model or recovery architecture.

---

## Programmable Authorization

Conditional authorization rules are being explored as an extension to the session model.

This includes:
- Multi-sig-like approval flows
- Conditional rules based on transaction parameters
- Tiered authorization for different operation types
- Configurable approval requirements per wallet or per action

Programmable authorization would layer on top of the existing intent model, not replace it.

---

## Autonomous Workflow Infrastructure

Scheduled and recurring operations within policy bounds are under exploration.

This includes:
- Recurring transactions within pre-defined limits
- Scheduled operations that execute without real-time user presence
- Policy-gated automation that respects custody boundaries

Autonomous workflows would require explicit user opt-in and policy configuration before any automated execution occurs.

---

## Extended On-Chain Interactions

Additional on-chain interactions beyond basic wallet usage may be supported in controlled environments or limited releases.

This includes:
- DeFi interactions
- Program-specific transaction support
- Advanced token operations

---

## Experimental Means

A feature listed as experimental:
- May lack full hardening or edge-case coverage
- May be disabled without notice
- May change behavior or scope
- Is not guaranteed to remain available

Experimental features may be exposed only to specific environments, builds, or user groups.

---

## No Reliance or Guarantees

Experimental functionality:
- Is not production-grade
- Should not be relied upon for asset security
- Does not imply future availability or roadmap commitment

GripLock makes no guarantees regarding the continuation, removal, or final form of experimental features.

---

## Relationship to Core Principles

Any experimental feature that conflicts with GripLock's core design principles:
- Will not graduate to production
- Will be revised or removed

Custody boundaries are non-negotiable. No experimental feature will grant custody of keys or MASTER_SECRET to any external system, agent, or service.

Experiments exist to test boundaries, not to redefine the system.

> **Note**
> Experimental features are intentionally separated from live functionality.
> Their presence does not change GripLock's core role as a privacy and control layer.
