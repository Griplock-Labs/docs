# What's Experimental

This page describes functionality that exists in **experimental, exploratory, or non-production** form.

Features listed here may change, be removed, or never reach production.  
They should not be relied upon for long-term usage or guarantees.

## Experimental Capabilities

The following areas are currently under experimentation or active exploration:

- **Extended on-chain interactions**  
  Additional on-chain interactions beyond basic wallet usage may be supported in controlled environments or limited releases.

- **Swap functionality**  
  Asset swaps may be available as an experimental capability.  
  Swaps are treated as a convenience feature and not as a core product focus.

- **Advanced privacy mechanisms**  
  Certain privacy-related techniques or flows may be tested to improve interaction control and exposure reduction.

- **Alternative authentication flows**  
  Additional intent or confirmation mechanisms may be explored to complement NFC-based physical intent.

## Experimental Means

A feature listed as experimental:
- May lack full hardening or edge-case coverage
- May be disabled without notice
- May change behavior or scope
- Is not guaranteed to remain available

Experimental features may be exposed only to specific environments, builds, or user groups.

---

## No Reliance or Guarantees

Experimental functionality:
- Is not production-grade
- Should not be relied upon for asset security
- Does not imply future availability or roadmap commitment

Griplock makes no guarantees regarding the continuation, removal, or final form of experimental features.

## Relationship to Core Principles

Any experimental feature that conflicts with Griplock’s core design principles:
- Will not graduate to production
- Will be revised or removed

Experiments exist to test boundaries, not to redefine the system.

> Experimental features are intentionally separated from live functionality.  
> Their presence does not change Griplock’s core role as a privacy and control layer.
