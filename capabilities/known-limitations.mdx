Griplock is designed to enforce privacy and control through explicit user intent.

This design introduces intentional limitations.  
They are not bugs or missing features — they are deliberate trade-offs aligned with the system’s goals.

---

## No Always-On Access

Griplock does not provide continuous wallet availability.

If no wallet session exists:
- No balances are usable  
- No transactions can be signed  
- No interactions can occur  

Users must explicitly create a new wallet session each time access is needed.

---

## Slower Access Compared to Traditional Wallets

Because access requires physical intent and local confirmation:
- Wallet access may be slower than always-on wallets  
- Background usage is not supported  

This trade-off is intentional and central to reducing exposure.

---

## No Automated or Delegated Usage

Griplock does not support:
- Scheduled transactions  
- Background signing  
- Bots or automated scripts  
- Delegated or third-party execution  

All interactions require real-time user presence and intent.

---

## No Custodial Recovery

Griplock cannot recover wallets or reset access on behalf of users.

If required access factors are lost:
- Griplock cannot bypass security controls  
- Funds remain on-chain but may be inaccessible through Griplock  

There is no centralized recovery or override mechanism.

---

## Limited Compatibility with Third-Party Tools

Some external tools assume:
- Persistent wallets  
- Background signers  
- Continuous connectivity  

These assumptions may not align with Griplock’s session-based model, resulting in limited or no compatibility.

---

## Privacy Is Not Anonymity

Griplock reduces interaction exposure.  
It does not provide anonymity or unlinkability.

Blockchain-level transparency remains unchanged.

---

## Experimental Feature Stability

Features labeled as experimental:
- May change or be removed  
- May behave inconsistently  
- Are not guaranteed to reach production  

Experimental functionality should not be relied upon for critical use cases.

---

## Evolving System

Griplock is an evolving system.

Behavior, capabilities, and limitations may change as the system matures.  
Documentation reflects the current state and does not imply future guarantees.

> **Summary**  
> Griplock trades convenience and automation for control and reduced exposure.  
> These limitations are intentional and fundamental to its design.
