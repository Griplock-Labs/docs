GripLock is designed to enforce privacy and control through explicit user intent.

This design introduces intentional limitations.
They are not bugs or missing features — they are deliberate trade-offs aligned with the system's goals.

---

## No Always-On Access

GripLock does not provide continuous wallet availability.

If no wallet session exists:
- No MASTER_SECRET is reconstructed
- No balances are usable
- No transactions can be signed
- No interactions can occur

Users must explicitly create a new wallet session each time access is needed, through NFC tap and factor authentication.

---

## Slower Access Compared to Traditional Wallets

Because access requires physical intent and local confirmation:
- Wallet access may be slower than always-on wallets
- Background usage is not supported
- Session creation involves NFC tap, authentication, and share reconstruction (or cache retrieval)

Session key caching reduces latency for repeat access, but does not eliminate the authentication requirement.

This trade-off is intentional and central to reducing exposure.

---

## No Automated or Delegated Usage (Current)

GripLock does not currently support:
- Scheduled transactions
- Background signing
- Bots or automated scripts
- Delegated or third-party execution

All interactions require real-time user presence and intent.

A future agent execution layer is planned that would allow agent-initiated transactions within user-defined policy bounds, while preserving custody boundaries. This capability is experimental and not yet live.

---

## Recovery Requires 2-of-3 Factors

GripLock uses a 2-of-3 Shamir threshold recovery model.

Recovery requires access to at least 2 of the 3 share storage factors:
- Google Drive
- Device
- Passkey

If 2 or more factors are lost simultaneously:
- The MASTER_SECRET cannot be reconstructed
- Funds remain on-chain but may be inaccessible through GripLock

There is no custodial recovery, master override, or support-assisted restoration. GripLock does not hold any shares or recovery data.

---

## NFC Required for Intent

NFC tap is required to initiate every wallet session.

This means:
- A compatible NFC device must be available
- Physical proximity is required
- Remote-only access is not supported

NFC serves as a physical intent gate. It does not perform cryptographic operations or store sensitive data.

---

## No Seed Phrase

GripLock V2 does not use a mnemonic seed phrase.

The wallet is derived from a random MASTER_SECRET protected by Shamir shares.
Users cannot export or import a seed phrase for recovery or migration to other wallets.

---

## Limited Compatibility with Third-Party Tools

Some external tools assume:
- Persistent wallets
- Background signers
- Continuous connectivity
- Seed phrase import/export

These assumptions may not align with GripLock's session-based model, resulting in limited or no compatibility.

---

## Privacy Is Not Anonymity

GripLock reduces interaction exposure.
It does not provide anonymity or unlinkability.

Blockchain-level transparency remains unchanged.

---

## Experimental Feature Stability

Features labeled as experimental:
- May change or be removed
- May behave inconsistently
- Are not guaranteed to reach production

Experimental functionality should not be relied upon for critical use cases.

---

## Evolving System

GripLock is an evolving system.

Behavior, capabilities, and limitations may change as the system matures.
Documentation reflects the current state and does not imply future guarantees.

---

> **Summary**
> GripLock trades convenience and automation for control and reduced exposure.
> These limitations are intentional and fundamental to its design.
