# What's Live

This page describes the functionality that is **currently implemented and available** in Griplock.

Only features listed here should be considered production-ready.  
Anything not listed here is either experimental or not part of the current system.

## Core System Capabilities

The following capabilities are live and operational as part of the Griplock system:

- **NFC-based physical intent enforcement**  
  Wallet sessions can only be created through explicit physical interaction and local user confirmation.

- **Session-based wallet access**  
  Wallet access exists only within an active, user-initiated session and is removed immediately when the session ends.

- **Local key derivation**  
  Cryptographic keys are derived locally during active sessions and are never stored persistently or transmitted to servers.

- **Ephemeral wallet sessions**  
  Wallet sessions are temporary by design and leave no residual access after termination.

---

## Privacy Model (Live)

The following privacy behaviors are currently enforced:

- **Private Receive**  
  Funds can be received without activating a wallet session or exposing interaction capability.

- **Shielded balances by default**  
  Received funds remain non-interactable until the user explicitly creates a wallet session.

- **Unshielding by explicit intent**  
  Interaction with funds requires physical presence and session-bound confirmation.

---

## Interaction Capabilities

During an active wallet session, users can:

- View balances
- Sign transactions
- Initiate supported on-chain interactions

All interaction capability is strictly bound to the active session.

---

## Supported On-Chain Actions

Griplock supports basic wallet-level on-chain actions, including:

- Native transfers
- Supported token transfers
- Basic on-chain interactions required for standard wallet usage

These actions do not execute without an active wallet session.

## What “Live” Means

A feature is considered live if it:
- Is implemented in the production codebase
- Has a defined interaction flow
- Does not rely on experimental assumptions
- Adheres fully to Griplock’s design principles

Anything outside this scope is not considered live.
