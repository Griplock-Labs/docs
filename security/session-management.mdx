# Session Management

Griplock manages wallet access through explicitly bounded **wallet sessions**.

A session defines when a wallet can exist, interact, and sign transactions.  
Outside of an active session, no wallet access is possible.

This page describes how sessions are created, maintained, and terminated.

---

## Session Creation Conditions

A wallet session can be created only when all required conditions are met.

These conditions include:
- Physical presence of the user
- NFC interaction
- Local user confirmation

If any condition is missing or fails validation, the session is not created.

There is no background or automatic session creation.

---

## Active Session State

While a session is active:
- Signing capability is enabled
- Shielded balances may become usable
- On-chain interactions may be initiated

All actions are strictly scoped to the active session.  
There is no persistence beyond it.

---

## Session Boundaries

Each wallet session is:
- Isolated from previous sessions
- Independent of future sessions
- Bound to a single intent window

Session data is not shared or reused across sessions.

Once a session ends, it cannot be resumed.

---

## Session Termination

A session terminates under any of the following conditions:
- The user explicitly exits the session
- The application is closed
- A predefined inactivity timeout is reached
- Local security constraints are violated

Session termination is immediate and irreversible.

---

## Post-Termination Behavior

When a session ends:
- Derived keys are destroyed
- Encryption keys are discarded
- Signing capability is removed
- Balances return to a shielded, non-interactable state

No residual access remains after termination.

---

## No Background Sessions

Griplock does not support:
- Background wallet sessions
- Silent reactivation
- Deferred signing
- Delegated session control

Every session requires fresh, explicit user intent.

---

## Security Implications

By enforcing strict session boundaries, Griplock:
- Limits the impact of device compromise
- Prevents long-lived access
- Eliminates unattended wallet usage

Session existence is treated as a **privilege**, not a default state.

> **Summary**  
> In Griplock, wallet access is session-based, temporary, and explicit.  
> When a session ends, access ends with it.
