Griplock uses encryption to protect data **during active wallet sessions**.

Encryption in Griplock is designed to secure communication and session data without introducing persistent secrets, centralized key storage, or long-lived credentials.

This page describes how encryption is used within the system and what it is intended to protect.

---

## Scope of Encryption

Encryption in Griplock applies to:
- Session communication between client components
- Locally derived session data
- Temporary interaction state during an active wallet session

Encryption does not replace key management or custody controls.  
It complements the session-based security model.

---

## Session-Scoped Encryption

All encrypted communication in Griplock is scoped to an active wallet session.

This means:
- Encryption keys are created per session
- Keys are not reused across sessions
- Encrypted channels cease to exist when the session ends

There are no long-lived encryption keys tied to user accounts or devices.

---

## End-to-End Session Protection

During an active session:
- Data exchanged between client components is encrypted
- Session state is protected from passive observation
- Communication is secured against interception and tampering

Griplock does not rely on encrypted storage of long-term secrets.  
Encryption exists only to protect **in-flight and in-memory session data**.

---

## No Server-Side Decryption

Griplock servers do not have access to plaintext private keys, signing material, or decrypted session state.

Servers act only as:
- Transport layers
- Coordination endpoints

They are unable to independently decrypt or reconstruct wallet sessions.

---

## Ephemeral Encryption Keys

Encryption keys in Griplock are:
- Generated locally
- Bound to the active session
- Stored only in volatile memory
- Discarded immediately when the session ends

Once a session terminates, encrypted data becomes unusable.

---

## What the Encryption Model Does and Does Not Do

Encryption does:
- Protect session communication
- Prevent passive interception
- Limit exposure during active use

Encryption does not:
- Enable account recovery
- Create persistent identity
- Provide anonymity guarantees
- Replace physical intent requirements

Encryption supports the system.  
It does not override Griplock’s intent-first model.

---

## Security Implications

By limiting encryption to active sessions, Griplock:
- Avoids long-lived encrypted attack surfaces
- Reduces key reuse risk
- Ensures session termination also terminates cryptographic access

Security is enforced through **ephemerality**, not accumulation.
