# Key Derivation & Lifecycle

Griplock does not store long-lived private keys.

Instead, cryptographic keys are **derived locally**, used within a controlled wallet session, and discarded immediately when that session ends.

This page describes how keys are created, used, and destroyed within the Griplock system.

---

## No Persistent Keys

Griplock does not maintain persistent private keys on:
- Servers
- User accounts
- Background services

Private keys do not exist unless an active wallet session exists.

If there is no session, there are no usable keys.

---

## Local Key Derivation

Key derivation occurs only after a wallet session is explicitly created through physical intent.

Derivation happens:
- Locally on the user’s device
- In volatile memory
- Only for the duration of the session

Private keys are never transmitted to Griplock servers or external services.

---

## Session-Bound Usage

Once derived, keys are used exclusively within the active wallet session.

During this period:
- Transactions may be constructed and signed
- On-chain interactions may be initiated
- Signing capability is limited to the session scope

There is no background signing and no delegated execution.

---

## Key Destruction

When a wallet session ends, derived keys are immediately discarded.

Session termination may occur due to:
- Explicit user exit
- Application closure
- Session timeout
- Local security conditions being violated

After termination:
- Keys are removed from memory
- Signing capability no longer exists
- The wallet becomes inaccessible again

There is no key persistence between sessions.

---

## Re-Derivation on Demand

To regain access, keys must be re-derived through a new wallet session.

This requires:
- Physical presence
- NFC interaction
- Local user confirmation

Each session produces fresh, temporary access without relying on previously stored keys.

---

## Security Implications

By deriving keys only when needed and destroying them afterward, Griplock:
- Reduces exposure to long-lived key compromise
- Prevents background or unattended signing
- Limits the impact of device-level attacks

Key availability is minimized by design.
