Griplock is designed around user-controlled security and explicit intent.

As a result, recovery behavior in Griplock follows a strict assumption model.  
This page explains what can and cannot be recovered, and under what conditions.

---

## No Custodial Recovery

Griplock does not custody keys, accounts, or recovery data.

This means:
- Griplock cannot restore wallets on behalf of users
- Griplock cannot reset access independently
- Griplock cannot bypass security controls

There is no centralized recovery mechanism.

---

## Session-Based Access Implications

Wallet access in Griplock is session-based and ephemeral.

If a session ends:
- Keys are destroyed
- Signing capability is removed
- Access must be re-initiated through physical intent

There is no persistent login or background access to recover.

---

## Loss of Device

If a user loses their device:
- No active wallet session remains
- No signing capability exists
- Funds remain on-chain and unaffected

Access can be regained only by recreating a wallet session on a new device using the same required inputs and credentials.

Griplock does not store backups of user keys or sessions.

---

## Loss of NFC Card

If an NFC card is lost or replaced:
- The card alone does not grant access
- Additional local confirmation is always required

Loss of an NFC card does not automatically compromise funds, but it may prevent session creation until a replacement is configured according to the user’s setup.

---

## Loss of Multiple Factors

If required access factors are lost simultaneously (e.g., device and credentials):
- Griplock cannot reconstruct access
- Funds remain on-chain but inaccessible through Griplock

Users are responsible for maintaining their own access continuity.

---

## User Responsibility Model

Griplock enforces intent and access boundaries.  
It does not remove user responsibility.

Users are responsible for:
- Safeguarding required access factors
- Understanding session-based behavior
- Managing their own operational security

Griplock provides control, not guarantees.

---

## Why These Assumptions Exist

These assumptions are intentional.

They ensure that:
- No backdoors exist
- No silent recovery paths are available
- No third party can regain access without user involvement

Security is preserved by refusing to offer shortcuts.

> **Summary**  
> Griplock cannot recover what it never stores.  
> Access exists only when the user can explicitly recreate it.
