# What is GRIPLOCK?

**The stealth digital asset manager that uses your existing NFC cards as a physical verification layer.**

Crypto security relies on software. Software can be exploited, seed phrases exposed, and access silently taken. GRIPLOCK adds a physical verification layer that turns the card you already carry into a lock for your digital assets.

**Without a tap, nothing moves.**

    Private keys are never stored anywhere. They're derived on-demand from your NFC card + PIN combination.

  <Card title="Physical Verification" icon="id-card">
    Your NFC card becomes an unforgeable hardware token. No card present = no access.

## Your Card. Your Vault.

GRIPLOCK implements a **two-factor derivation model** where your Solana wallet is computed from:

1. **NFC Card UID** — The unique hardware identifier in your card
2. **Your PIN** — A secret code only you know

Neither factor alone can access the wallet. Both must be present simultaneously.

## The GRIPLOCK Difference

Traditional wallets store private keys, creating a single point of failure. GRIPLOCK takes a fundamentally different approach:

| Traditional Wallets | GRIPLOCK |
|---------------------|----------|
| Private key stored on device | No key storage anywhere |
| Device theft = funds at risk | Card theft alone is useless |
| Seed phrases can be stolen | Nothing to steal |
| Complex backup procedures | Just remember your PIN |

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tap Your Card">
    Open the GRIPLOCK mobile app and tap any NFC card. The app reads the card's unique hardware identifier.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enter Your PIN">
    Input your secret PIN. The combination of card UID + PIN derives your wallet cryptographically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Access Your Wallet">
    Your Solana wallet appears on the dashboard with real balances, tokens, and transaction history.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Session Auto-Locks">
    After 15 minutes of inactivity, your session expires. Tap again to re-access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases

- **High-Security Storage** — Maximum protection without complex hardware wallets
- **Cold Storage Access** — Ephemeral access to cold funds when needed
- **Team Access Control** — Physical card presence required for transactions
- **Point-of-Sale** — Tap-to-access for momentary wallet authorization
