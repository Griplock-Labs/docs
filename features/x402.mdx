# Micropayments with x402 Protocol

GRIPLOCK integrates the x402 protocol—an open standard for internet-native payments. Pay for APIs, AI services, and content with micropayments as small as $0.001.

## What is x402?

x402 uses the HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code to enable machine-to-machine payments. When a service requires payment, it responds with payment details. Your wallet automatically handles the transaction.

| Compute | $0.001/second | Serverless functions |
| Storage | $0.001/MB | File hosting |

### AI Agents

Configure spending limits for autonomous agents:

```typescript
// Agent spending configuration
{
  "maxPerTransaction": "0.10",  // Max $0.10 per transaction
  "dailyLimit": "5.00",         // Max $5 per day
  "approvedDomains": [          // Only pay these services
    "api.openai.com",
    "api.anthropic.com"
  ]
}
```

### Content Access

## Technical Integration

### For Developers

GRIPLOCK wallets support x402 natively. Services can request payment:

```typescript
// Service responds with 402
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
X-Payment-Amount: 0.01
X-Payment-Currency: USDC
X-Payment-Address: YOUR_SOLANA_ADDRESS
X-Payment-Network: solana

// GRIPLOCK wallet handles payment automatically
// Then resends request with payment proof
```

### Supported Networks

| Network | Currency | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Solana** | USDC | Active |
| **Base** | USDC | Active |
| **Ethereum** | USDC | Coming Soon |
