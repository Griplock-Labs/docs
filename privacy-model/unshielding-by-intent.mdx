# Unshielding by Intent

Unshielding in Griplock is the act of temporarily enabling interaction with shielded funds through explicit user intent.

Unshielding does not change ownership, fund location, or on-chain state.  
It only enables **session-bound usability**.

## What Unshielding Is

Unshielding allows:
- Temporary access to shielded balances
- Transaction signing within an active wallet session
- Explicit, user-approved interaction with funds

Unshielding is always:
- Intentional
- Time-limited
- Bound to an active wallet session

---

## What Unshielding Is Not

Unshielding is not:
- Automatic
- Persistent
- A change in custody
- A change in on-chain visibility

Funds do not become permanently unlocked.  
They remain shielded by default outside of an active session.

---

## How Unshielding Occurs

Unshielding can occur only when the user:
- Is physically present
- Creates an active wallet session via NFC
- Confirms the intended interaction locally

Without all of these conditions, unshielding cannot happen.

There is no background or delayed unshielding process.

---

## Session-Bound Access

When a wallet session is active:
- Shielded balances become usable
- Signing capability is enabled
- Interactions are allowed only within that session

Once the session ends:
- Signing capability is removed
- Balances automatically return to a shielded state
- No residual access remains

Unshielding is reversible by default through session termination.

---

## Explicit Control Model

Unshielding places control directly in the user’s hands.

There is no silent unlock.  
There is no delegated access.  
There is no automated usage.

Every interaction requires conscious user action at the time it occurs.

## Security and Privacy Implications

By enforcing unshielding through explicit intent, Griplock:
- Prevents unintended fund usage
- Reduces exposure to remote exploitation
- Eliminates background interaction risk

Privacy is preserved by ensuring that usability exists only when the user is present and engaged.

> **Summary**  
> In Griplock, unshielding is not a mode you turn on.  
> It is a temporary state created by explicit user intent — and removed automatically when that intent ends.
