Unshielding in GripLock is the act of temporarily enabling interaction with shielded funds through explicit user intent.

Unshielding does not change ownership, fund location, or on-chain state.
It only enables **session-bound usability**.

## What Unshielding Is

Unshielding allows:
- Temporary access to shielded balances
- Transaction signing within an active wallet session
- Explicit, user-approved interaction with funds

Unshielding is always:
- Intentional
- Time-limited
- Bound to an active wallet session

---

## What Unshielding Is Not

Unshielding is not:
- Automatic
- Persistent
- A change in custody
- A change in on-chain visibility

Funds do not become permanently unlocked.
They remain shielded by default outside of an active session.

## How Unshielding Occurs in V2

Unshielding follows the V2 unlock flow:

1. **NFC Tap** — The user initiates physical intent by tapping their NFC device. NFC serves as an intent gate only; it does not perform any cryptographic operation.

2. **Authentication** — The user authenticates using a supported factor: Passkey or PIN. This verifies the user's identity and authorizes session creation.

3. **MASTER_SECRET Reconstruction** — The system reconstructs the MASTER_SECRET using 2-of-3 Shamir threshold shares. If a valid session cache exists, the cached session key may be used instead, avoiding full share reconstruction for performance.

4. **Signing Capability** — With the MASTER_SECRET available, the wallet keypair is derived and signing capability is temporarily enabled.

5. **Session End** — When the session ends, the MASTER_SECRET is cleared from memory. Signing capability is removed. Balances return to a shielded state.

Without NFC intent and successful authentication, unshielding cannot occur.
There is no background or delayed unshielding process.

## Session Cache and Performance

GripLock V2 supports session key caching to reduce reconstruction overhead.

When a session cache is valid:
- The MASTER_SECRET does not need to be fully reconstructed from Shamir shares
- The cached session key enables faster session resumption
- All security boundaries remain enforced

Session caching does not bypass authentication.
It reduces latency, not security.

---

## Session-Bound Access

When a wallet session is active:
- Shielded balances become usable
- Signing capability is enabled
- Interactions are allowed only within that session

Once the session ends:
- The MASTER_SECRET is cleared
- Signing capability is removed
- Balances automatically return to a shielded state
- No residual access remains

Unshielding is reversible by default through session termination.

---

## Explicit Control Model

Unshielding places control directly in the user's hands.

There is no silent unlock.
There is no delegated access.
There is no automated usage.

Every interaction requires conscious user action at the time it occurs: NFC tap, authentication, and session-bound confirmation.

---

## Security and Privacy Implications

By enforcing unshielding through explicit intent, GripLock:
- Prevents unintended fund usage
- Reduces exposure to remote exploitation
- Eliminates background interaction risk
- Ensures the MASTER_SECRET exists in memory only when needed

Privacy is preserved by ensuring that usability exists only when the user is present and engaged.

> **Summary**
> In GripLock, unshielding is not a mode you turn on.
> It is a temporary state created by NFC tap, authentication, and MASTER_SECRET reconstruction — and removed automatically when the session ends.
