A shielded balance refers to funds that exist on-chain but are **not immediately usable**.

Shielding in GripLock is a control state, not an obfuscation technique.
Funds are not hidden, altered, or removed from the blockchain.

What changes is **interaction availability**, not ownership or visibility.

## What "Shielded" Means

In GripLock V2, a balance is considered shielded when:
- Funds are owned by the user on-chain
- No active wallet session exists
- The MASTER_SECRET has not been reconstructed
- Signing capability is unavailable

Shielded balances cannot be interacted with until the user explicitly creates a wallet session through physical intent and factor authentication.

---

## Shielded by Default

Balances received through GripLock flows are shielded by default.

This means:
- Funds can be received at any time
- Balances remain inactive during idle periods
- No background wallet or signer exists
- No MASTER_SECRET resides in memory

Shielding prevents balances from being accidentally or remotely accessed when the user is not present.

---

## No UI Masking

Shielded balance is not a UI feature.

It is not achieved by:
- Hiding numbers in the interface
- Blurring balances
- Delaying display only

Shielding is enforced at the system level by the absence of a reconstructed MASTER_SECRET and an active wallet session.

If no session exists, the balance cannot be used — regardless of what the UI shows.

---

## Session-Bound Availability

When a wallet session is created through NFC tap and authentication:
- The MASTER_SECRET is reconstructed from 2-of-3 Shamir shares (or retrieved from a valid session cache)
- Signing keys are derived
- Shielded balances become temporarily usable
- Interaction is permitted only within that session

Once the session ends:
- The MASTER_SECRET is cleared from memory
- Signing capability is removed
- Balances return to a shielded state
- No residual access remains

Shielding and unshielding are tied strictly to MASTER_SECRET availability and session state.

---

## What Shielded Balance Does and Does Not Do

Shielded balance does:
- Reduce exposure during idle periods
- Limit automated or background interaction
- Enforce explicit user intent before usage
- Keep the MASTER_SECRET unrecoverable outside of sessions

Shielded balance does not:
- Hide balances from the blockchain
- Obfuscate transaction history
- Pool or reroute funds
- Provide anonymity guarantees

GripLock does not alter blockchain transparency.
It alters **when balances can be acted upon**.

---

## Security Implications

By keeping balances shielded when no session exists, GripLock:
- Reduces the attack surface of dormant wallets
- Prevents background signing
- Limits passive wallet probing
- Ensures the MASTER_SECRET is never persistently available

Security is achieved by making inactivity the safest state.

---

> **Summary**
> A shielded balance is owned, verifiable, and on-chain — but unusable by default.
> No MASTER_SECRET is reconstructed and no signing is possible until the user explicitly creates a session.
