# Shielded Balance

A shielded balance refers to funds that exist on-chain but are **not immediately usable**.

Shielding in Griplock is a control state, not an obfuscation technique.  
Funds are not hidden, altered, or removed from the blockchain.

What changes is **interaction availability**, not ownership or visibility.

## What “Shielded” Means

In Griplock, a balance is considered shielded when:
- Funds are owned by the user on-chain
- No active wallet session exists
- Signing capability is unavailable

Shielded balances cannot be interacted with until the user explicitly creates a wallet session through physical intent.

---

## Shielded by Default

Balances received through Griplock flows are shielded by default.

This means:
- Funds can be received at any time
- Balances remain inactive during idle periods
- No background wallet or signer exists

Shielding prevents balances from being accidentally or remotely accessed when the user is not present.

---

## No UI Masking

Shielded balance is not a UI feature.

It is not achieved by:
- Hiding numbers in the interface
- Blurring balances
- Delaying display only

Shielding is enforced at the system level by the absence of an active wallet session.

If no session exists, the balance cannot be used — regardless of what the UI shows.

---

## Session-Bound Availability

When a wallet session is created:
- Shielded balances become temporarily usable
- Signing capability is enabled
- Interaction is permitted only within that session

Once the session ends:
- Signing capability is removed
- Balances return to a shielded state
- No residual access remains

Shielding and unshielding are tied strictly to session state.

---

## What Shielded Balance Does and Does Not Do

Shielded balance does:
- Reduce exposure during idle periods
- Limit automated or background interaction
- Enforce explicit user intent before usage

Shielded balance does not:
- Hide balances from the blockchain
- Obfuscate transaction history
- Pool or reroute funds
- Provide anonymity guarantees

Griplock does not alter blockchain transparency.  
It alters **when balances can be acted upon**.

---

## Security Implications

By keeping balances shielded when no session exists, Griplock:
- Reduces the attack surface of dormant wallets
- Prevents background signing
- Limits passive wallet probing

Security is achieved by making inactivity the safest state.

> **Summary**  
> A shielded balance is owned, verifiable, and on-chain — but unusable by default.  
> Interaction is unlocked only through explicit, session-bound user intent.
