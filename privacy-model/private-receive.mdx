Private Receive allows funds to be received without immediately exposing them for interaction.

It separates the act of **receiving funds** from the ability to **use funds**, reducing unnecessary exposure during idle periods.

Funds received through Private Receive always remain on-chain and verifiable.

## What Private Receive Does

Private Receive enables:
- Receiving funds without activating a wallet session
- Holding funds in a non-interactable state by default
- Delaying balance usability until explicit user intent is provided

Receiving funds does not grant signing capability.  
Interaction remains locked until a wallet session is created.

## How Private Receive Works

Private Receive operates through the same session-based model as the rest of Griplock.

When funds are sent to a Griplock-derived address:
- The transaction is recorded on-chain
- Ownership is preserved
- No wallet session is created automatically

Without an active wallet session:
- No private keys are derived
- No transactions can be signed
- No on-chain actions can be initiated

---

## No Always-On Wallet

Private Receive does not rely on an always-on wallet.

Funds can be received at any time, but the wallet itself only exists when the user explicitly creates a session through physical intent.

This ensures that receiving funds does not expand the attack surface.

---

## What Private Receive Is Not

Private Receive is not:
- A mixer or tumbling mechanism
- A way to hide funds from the blockchain
- A method for anonymizing transactions

It does not alter transaction history, routing, or on-chain visibility.

Privacy is achieved by limiting **interaction availability**, not by modifying blockchain data.

---

## Security and Privacy Benefits

By decoupling receipt from interaction, Private Receive:
- Reduces passive wallet exposure
- Prevents unintended interaction
- Limits automated or remote exploitation attempts

Funds remain safe, inactive, and unusable until the user intentionally unlocks access.

> **Summary**  
> Private Receive allows funds to arrive without waking the wallet.  
> Access remains locked until the user explicitly chooses to interact.
