Private Receive allows funds to be received without immediately exposing them for interaction.

It separates the act of **receiving funds** from the ability to **use funds**, reducing unnecessary exposure during idle periods.

Funds received through Private Receive always remain on-chain and verifiable.

## What Private Receive Does

Private Receive enables:
- Receiving funds without activating a wallet session
- Holding funds in a non-interactable state by default
- Delaying balance usability until explicit user intent is provided

Receiving funds does not trigger MASTER_SECRET reconstruction.
No signing capability exists until the user explicitly initiates a session.

## How Private Receive Works

Private Receive operates through the V2 session-based model.

When funds are sent to a GripLock wallet address:
- The transaction is recorded on-chain
- Ownership is preserved
- No wallet session is created automatically
- No MASTER_SECRET is reconstructed

Without an active wallet session:
- No MASTER_SECRET exists in memory
- No signing keys are derived
- No transactions can be signed
- No on-chain actions can be initiated

Even if a session cache exists from a prior session, receiving funds does not reactivate it. Access requires explicit user intent through NFC and authentication.

---

## No Always-On Wallet

Private Receive does not rely on an always-on wallet.

Funds can be received at any time, but the wallet's signing capability only exists when the user explicitly creates a session through physical intent and factor authentication.

The MASTER_SECRET — from which the wallet's keypair is derived — is never persistently stored in plaintext. It must be reconstructed from Shamir shares or retrieved from a valid session cache before any interaction is possible.

This ensures that receiving funds does not expand the attack surface.

## What Private Receive Is Not

Private Receive is not:
- A mixer or tumbling mechanism
- A way to hide funds from the blockchain
- A method for anonymizing transactions

It does not alter transaction history, routing, or on-chain visibility.

Privacy is achieved by limiting **interaction availability**, not by modifying blockchain data.

---

## Security and Privacy Benefits

By decoupling receipt from interaction, Private Receive:
- Reduces passive wallet exposure
- Prevents unintended interaction
- Limits automated or remote exploitation attempts
- Keeps the MASTER_SECRET unrecoverable until explicit intent

Funds remain safe, inactive, and unusable until the user intentionally unlocks access through NFC tap and factor authentication.

> **Summary**
> Private Receive allows funds to arrive without waking the wallet.
> No keys are derived and no MASTER_SECRET is reconstructed until the user explicitly chooses to interact.
